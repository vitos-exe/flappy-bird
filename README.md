# Flappy bird
Simple flappy bird clone created with pygame. Press arrow up to jump. When the bird collides with any tube or touches top or bottom borders game ends.
Score counting is based on simple timing logic(if you don't lose then the bird passes tube pair every defined period of time and so you get the point).
